      <h2>Adult word in Dictionary</h2>

      <p>
        As a dictionary, our content includes a wide range of words, including those
        that may be considered adult or sensitive in nature. These words are solely
        provided for their definitions and to offer a comprehensive understanding of
        language and vocabulary.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to maintaining an inclusive and informative dictionary while
        recognizing that some words may be unsuitable for certain audiences. Therefore,
        we advise parental guidance for younger users and recommend that individuals
        use our dictionary responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and
        regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our primary goal is to provide accurate and reliable definitions to serve the
        educational and linguistic needs of our users. We do not endorse or promote
        explicit, harmful, or offensive content. Our intention is to present words
        within the context of language, free from explicit material or harmful intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you come across any content that you find inappropriate or offensive,
        please notify us immediately, and we will take appropriate measures to address
        the concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are dedicated to fostering a respectful and safe environment for all users
        of our dictionary, and we encourage open communication to ensure the continued
        improvement of our services.

        to content in the dictionary, feel free to reach out to us. Your feedback is
        essential in helping us maintain the quality and appropriateness of our
        dictionary for everyone's benefit.

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>{{ appName }}</strong> gathers information about all visitors to
        <q>{{ appDomain }}</q>, such as the time and date of the visit, the operating
        system and browser used, the domain from where you visited, where you were
        redirected from, and the pages you browsed. This information is used solely
        for generating server usage statistics and improving
        <strong>{{ appName }}</strong>. We do not collect personally identifiable
        information, such as your name, postcode, or e-mail address, nor do we relate
        personal information to usage statistics. However, we do record emails sent
        from <strong>{{ appName }}</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any member with an account at <strong>{{ appName }}</strong> may request
        personal information that might be considered personal. We will explain why
        information is required for a service and how it will be used. Information
        will be stored for as long as you use the service or until you request to
        terminate your registration.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing and Privacy</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>{{ appName }}</strong> will not disclose any personal information to
        outside organizations or companies. Member information will not be publicly
        displayed unless you have shared it yourself. If you hold an account, the
        information will only be available to relevant staff members within
        <q>{{ appDomain }}</q>, and you will be asked directly if we upgrade/increase
        our services. Registration through Firebase is for users who wish to
        contribute words, definitions, or comments, and it does not affect the search
        for definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>{{ appName }}</strong> defines your IP address through cookies
        (visited or not) from your machine. The purpose is to count visitors, track
        visit duration, and measure time since your last visit. Our cookies do not
        collect any personal information or information about your machine. Sessions
        are deleted when the browser window is closed.
      </p>
