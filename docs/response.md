# response

It is truly unfortunate that the Myanmar Text(utf8) is not properly displayed. I am, however glad to know this issue and contacting me.

In order to fixed the issue, there are 2 options.

1. browser (client)
2. website (server)

...

## Problem

...was, yours browser is forcing to display any Myanmar Text in the form of Zawgyi. If you could restore to the default font setting will solved the issue, however any webpage written in Zawgyi and the required font is not embedded/installed(O/S) will be a problem.

### Quick fix for windows-10

Since windows-8 Myanmar text can be read and write without external program.

- get Zawgyi-One(https://www.myordbok.com/myanmar-fonts/primary?font=Zawgyi-One_V3.1.ttf) and install
- restore default font setting in Browser
  - chorme: chrome://settings/fonts?search=font
  - firefox: about:preferences(general->fonts-and-color)
- and probably restart(!!!)

...so that you enabled both it proper visibility

> Please note that many of Myanmar blogs were written in Zawgyi but does not specify the font-name, so your browser might not show them accordingly.

## MyOrdbok (website)

Starting from MyOrdbok 1.5.7, we stopped embedding Myanmar font(Myanmar3, Paduak) directly from our serverÂ and load Google font (https://fonts.google.com/?subset=myanmar) instead. Because of most latest O/S supported Myanmar-Text by default.

...to

- speed up
- save bandwidth

My curiosity is that if you were using MyOrdbok with your current system configuration before (v1.5.7) without any issue and if you could reply me with the approximate time of the issue were happening.

Please let me know if it is help, or if I can assist you any further.
